Analysis
1.  In the Northern Hemisphere, temperature and latitude are negatively correlated so as latitude increases, temperature decreases.  While in the Southern Hemisphere, temperature and latitude are positively correlated.  So as latitude increases, so does the temperature. 
2.  Cloudiness and latitude do not appear to be correlated based on the sample data. 
3.  Humidity appears to be positively correlated to latitude in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.
